# How to predict who is playing a game of Starcraft 2
We consider the video game StarCraft 2. This real-time strategy game is played competitively by cyber-athletes as an electronic sport (esport), and most of the competitions are played online. A major issue for competition organizers is that they need to verify the identify of a player, for being sure that it is not another player (a friend with better chances, â€¦).

For that matter, we propose to study how it is possible to determine who is playing given a behavioral trace (game events produced by the player) by designing a prediction model using machine learning techniques.

We were provided with a large set of SC2 replay data, from which we needed to build features and train a model.


We used different machine learning techniques as DecisionTree, RandomForestClassifier with tuned hyperparameters, and combination of RandomForestClassifier and AdaBoost in order to obtain a better score.

We try to explain what we have done step by step through this 3 Jupyter Notebooks:
